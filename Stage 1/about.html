                    <p>
                        I'm Daniel Udechukwu, a passionate developer with a keen
                        interest in creating meaningful digital experiences. My
                        journey into tech started with curiosity about how
                        things work and has evolved into a commitment to
                        continuous learning and growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in building solutions that not only work well
                        but are also accessible and user-friendly. Beyond
                        coding, I enjoy working with IoT devices, playing mobile
                        games, and constantly challenging myself to learn new
                        technologies.
